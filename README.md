# Ze1598Bot-Twitter-
A Twitter bot created to put scripts I create into practice
The bot was created using Python 3, and right now it does the following:

-Tweet date and time, in text (e.g.: "Date and time update: Today is Friday, December 29th, 2017. It's eleven forty three am.");

-Tweet articles' titles and URLs from various websites (wccftech, sciencemagazine, reddit and bbcworld at the moment);

-All the URLs used in tweets are shortened using the Google URL shortener API;

-For Reddit, it posts the "hottest" post at the moment, its title and shortened URL, from the Technology, Python Education or Programming subreddits;

-It can also post my current Internet speeds (though that option is "disabled" in the code at the moment).

-(Update dec. 30th 2017) Tweet the first result for a google query using a random word from the first tweet in the Bot's feed
