# Ze1598Bot-Twitter-
A Twitter bot created to put scripts I create into practice
The bot was created using Python 3, and right now it does the following:
    Tweet date and time, in text (e.g.: "Date and time update: Today is Friday, December 29th, 2017. It's eleven forty three am.")
    Tweet articles' titles and URLs from various websites (wccftech, sciencemagazine, reddit and bbcworld at the moment)
    All the URLs used in tweets are shortened using the Google URL shortener API
    For Reddit, it posts the "hottest" post at the moment, its title and shortened URL
    It can also post my current Internet speeds (though that option is "disabled" in the code at the moment)

I'm looking to add more and more functionalities as I progress in Python
Future planned updates:
    Tweet the first result for a google query using a random word from another person's tweet in the Bot's feed
