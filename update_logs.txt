-(dec. 30th 2017) Tweet the first result for a google query using a random word from the first tweet in the Bot's feed



-(jan. 1st 2018) Added a new version of dayOfTheWeek.py for 2018, by switch the existing one for dayOfTheWeek2018.py



-(jan. 3rd 2018) Added a try/except clause to the shortenURLs.py file, to prevent exceptions when, for instance, there's problems with the API servers. This way, the script will return the same URL (a long URL) but it won't raise any exceptions



-(jan. 14th. 2018) Updated scrape_sciencemagazine.py with an updated scraped URL



-(jan. 14th 2018) Added a PYtoJS folder: contains scripts in Python and JavaScript, so that it scrapes an article from a given website using Python, saves that information to a .json file and then reads that file and posts a tweet about it using JavaScript. Note: the current intermediaryJSON.json file's content is just an example of what the file may contain.



-(jan 22nd 2018) Added a way to work around cases when the retrieval of google query search results had problems. Now when this happens, the main file simply feeds that script a second word for it to search for (it assumes the problem won't happen with the second word). I also updated a string at the end of PYtoJS/targetJavaScript.js



-(feb. 6th 2018) Now the main script has the option to run the PYtoJS process



-(mar. 30th 2018) Corrected a bug where the URL for the scraped Science Magazine articles wasn't complete; Also removed the Date and Time Update from the possible tweets rotation



-(apr. 15th 2018) Migrated URL shortening from Google URL Shortener to Firebase Dynamic Links; also created a separate file for the update logs of the repo (from now on I will only keep the 3 most recent updates in the README)

-(june 14th 2018) Deleted the code used to tweet internet speeds due to problems with the module used for that. Also added the possibility to tweet the hottest post in the dadjokes subreddit

-(july 28th 2018) Added a new module (download_xkcd.py) to download and post the latest xkcd.com comic (posted as a media tweet). I also updated the main script structure (Ze1598BotTwitter.py)
